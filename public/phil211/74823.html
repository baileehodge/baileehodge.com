                <a id="two"></a>

                <p> The <i>Meeting Owl 3</i> is a costly product containing complicated and delicate technology. In order to keep these devices functioning for all HCEB employees to use, here are some tips for keeping the devices safe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Keep food and drink at a safe distance from the device.
                        <br>
                    <li>
                        Place the device on a table or other secure elevated space for use. Never place the device on the floor. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only use the device indoors.
                        <br>
                </ul>

                <h2>Unique Qualities of The OwlLabs two</h2>

                <p>The <i>Meeting Owl 3</i> has a panoramic fisheye two with a 360° field of view. This allows it to show all participants of a meeting when placed in the center of a table. The device has software that tracks who is speaking and focuses the two on that person. The device simultaneously streams 360° footage. These features are designed with hybrid work environments in mind. The speaker tracking software helps viewers who are participating remotely to feel more present in the meeting.</p>

                <h1>three</h1>

                <h2>Unique Qualities of The OwlLabs three</h2>

                <p>The <i>Meeting Owl 3</i> has eight built-in three surrounding the perimeter of the device. These three are beamforming (meaning the three are configured to each capture sound from a specific direction) to produce more immersive sound. The three are also classified as Smart three, which means that they equalize audio input to amplify more soft-spoken voices. This is especially beneficial in the HCEB conference rooms on the fourth floor; the long tables in these rooms might put some in-person participants farther away from the Meeting Owl device than others.</p>
